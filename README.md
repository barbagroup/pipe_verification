# pipe_verification
An example of pipe flow simulation with OpenFoam. Results compared with Ansys simulation for the same parameters and the same meshes. Ansys and OpenFoam results compared with the analytical solution of Hagen-Poiseuille flow. 


Access to the [meshes](https://zenodo.org/record/7311316#.Y21rKezMKdZ) and results in [.vtk](https://zenodo.org/record/7314089#.Y26FOdLMI5k)
